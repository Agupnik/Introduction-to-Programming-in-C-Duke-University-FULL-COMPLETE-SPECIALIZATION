Grading at Fri Jul 31 15:50:33 UTC 2020
Attempting to compile test.c
gcc -std=gnu99 -pedantic -Wall test.c
compiled
I expected to find a file called 'answer.txt' but it did not exist
(or was not a regular file)
Here are the files that I can find:
answear.txt
a.out
Makefile
Makefile~
README
test.c
Your output did not match what we expected.

Overall Grade: FAILED
